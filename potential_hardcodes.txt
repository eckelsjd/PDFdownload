1. xpath to find all children 'a' tags in the 'topics' class table is hardcoded for moodle page
2. format of moodle pdf links is hardcoded to sort the links in pdf_download
3. xpath of course page is coded based off user input, but format is hardcoded
4. Download directory is hardcoded, and moodle url
5. chrome preferences are hard coded

Xpaths used:

//*[text()='coure_num']//ancestor::a[1]   	- this finds the course button associated with 'course_num', and assumes the course list menu is open on the left of the web page by default
//ul[@class='topics']//child::a	 	  	- this finds all 'a' tag children in the main web 'ul' list on the course page
//section[@id='region-main']//child::button[1]	- this finds the download button on a folder web page
